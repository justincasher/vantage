# Contributing

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to this project! Collaboration is welcome and encouraged. Whether it's reporting a bug, discussing improvements, or submitting code changes, your help is valued.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms, available in the [**code_of_conduct.md**](code_of_conduct.md) file.

## How to Contribute

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, documentation updates, and other tasks. This is the primary place to find ways to help.

1.  **Find an Issue:** Head over to the [**Issues tab**](https://github.com/justincasher/vantage/issues) in our repository to see what needs attention.
2.  **Look for Labels:** To make things easier, we use labels to categorize issues. Keep an eye out for:
    * `good first issue`: These are specifically chosen as good starting points if you're new to the project. They should be well-defined and require less deep knowledge of the codebase.
    * `help wanted`: These are issues we've specifically marked as needing contributor help.
    * Other labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation` describe the type of work involved. *(Tip: You can filter the issues list by labels!)*
3.  **Write Clear Issues (If Creating New Ones):** If you're reporting a bug or suggesting a feature, please be as clear as possible. For bugs, include steps to reproduce, expected results, and actual results. This helps us understand and label the issue correctly.
4.  **Claim an Issue:** If you find an existing issue you'd like to work on, please leave a comment on the issue thread (e.g., "I'd like to work on this" or "I'll take this one"). This helps us avoid duplicated effort. A maintainer will then assign the issue to you.
5.  **Work on Your Contribution:**
    * Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
    * Create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/add-new-widget` or `git checkout -b fix/login-bug`).
    * Make your changes, following any coding style guidelines mentioned (you might want to add a section on this later!).
    * Commit your changes with clear commit messages.
6.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):**
    * Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
    * Open a Pull Request back to the main repository (`justincasher/vantage`).
    * In the PR description, please link the issue you're addressing by including text like "Closes #123" or "Fixes #123" (replace `123` with the actual issue number). This automatically links the PR to the issue and closes the issue when the PR is merged.
    * Provide a clear description of the changes you've made.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Please refer to the [**installation.md**](installation.md) file for detailed instructions on how to clone the repository, install dependencies, and set up your local development environment.

## Questions or Broader Discussions?

* For questions related to a **specific issue or Pull Request**, please use the comment section directly on GitHub within that issue/PR.
* For **broader ideas, strategic discussions, or if you're unsure where to start** and want to connect with the project lead, feel free to email **Justin Asher** directly at **justinchadwickasher@gmail.com**.
