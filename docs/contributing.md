# Contributing

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to this project! Collaboration is welcome and encouraged. Whether it's reporting a bug, discussing improvements, or submitting code changes, your help is valued.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms, available in the [**code of conduct**](code_of_conduct.md) file.

## How to Contribute

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, documentation updates, and other tasks. We also use a GitHub Project board to visualize our workflow, plan upcoming work, and track progress on higher-level objectives.

1.  **Find Work to Do:**
    * **Issues Tab:** Browse individual tasks directly on the [**Issues tab**](https://github.com/justincasher/vantage/issues). This is the primary list of all reported bugs, requested features, etc.
    * **Project Board:** Get a visual overview of our workflow, priorities, and what's currently in progress on our [**Project Board**](https://github.com/users/justincasher/projects/1/views/1). The board organizes many of the items from the Issues tab into different stages (like Todo, In Progress, Done) and helps show our planned roadmap.
2.  **Look for Labels:** Whether viewing the Issues tab or the Project Board (where labels are often visible on cards), keep an eye out for:
    * `good first issue`: Specifically chosen as good starting points if you're new.
    * `help wanted`: Issues specifically marked as needing contributor help.
    * Other labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation` describe the type of work. *(Tip: You can filter the issues list and sometimes the project board by labels!)*
3.  **Write Clear Issues (If Creating New Ones):** If you're reporting a bug or suggesting a feature not already tracked, please create a new issue on the [**Issues tab**](https://github.com/justincasher/vantage/issues) and be as clear as possible. For bugs, include steps to reproduce, expected results, and actual results.
4.  **Claim an Issue:** If you find an existing issue you'd like to work on (either via the Issues tab or the Project Board), please navigate to the issue itself and leave a comment (e.g., "I'd like to work on this"). This helps avoid duplicated effort. A maintainer can then assign the issue to you.
5.  **Work on Your Contribution:**
    * Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
    * Create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/add-new-widget` or `git checkout -b fix/login-bug`).
    * Make your changes, adhering to the project's coding style and testing requirements (see sections below).
    * Commit your changes with clear commit messages.
    * Ensure your changes pass all relevant tests before submitting.
6.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):**
    * Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
    * Open a Pull Request back to the main repository (`justincasher/vantage`).
    * In the PR description, please link the issue you're addressing by including text like "Closes #123" or "Fixes #123" (replace `123` with the actual issue number). This automatically links the PR to the issue and helps project tracking.
    * Provide a clear description of the changes you've made.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Please refer to the [**installation**](installation.md) file for detailed instructions on how to clone the repository, install dependencies, and set up your local development environment.

## Coding Style

Please ensure your code adheres to the guidelines outlined in the [**coding style guidelines**](coding_style_guidelines.md) file. This primarily involves following PEP 8 for formatting and Google Style for docstrings. Consistent code style helps maintain readability across the project.

## Testing

Contributions should include relevant tests (unit or integration) where applicable. Before submitting a Pull Request, please ensure all tests pass. For details on the testing strategy and how to run tests, refer to the [**testing**](testing.md) file.

## Questions or Broader Discussions?

* For questions related to a **specific issue or Pull Request**, please use the comment section directly on GitHub within that issue/PR.
* For **broader ideas, strategic discussions about the project's direction (which you might see reflected on the Project Board), or if you're unsure where to start** and want to connect with the project lead, feel free to email **Justin Asher** directly at **justinchadwickasher@gmail.com**.

Thank you for considering contributing!
