# Welcome to Vantage

> *The essence of mathematical insight often comes from finding a new vantage point.*

Vantage is a Python project designed to build and manage a mathematical knowledge base (KB). It leverages Lean 4 for formal verification, integrates with Large Language Models (specifically Google's Gemini) for potential code/description generation, and uses an SQLite database for persistent storage.

***Heads Up!*** *This project is currently under active development and is being built day-by-day. Features, documentation, and the overall structure may change frequently. Your patience and feedback are appreciated!*

This documentation provides detailed information on setting up, configuring, and using the Lean Automator.

* **[Installation & Setup](installation.md):** How to get the project running, including dependencies and shared library initialization.
* **[Configuration](configuration.md):** Details on environment variables and other settings.
* **[Usage](usage.md):** Examples of how to interact with the knowledge base, LLM, and Lean processor.
* **[Testing](testing.md):** Information on running the project's test suite.
* **[Project Structure](project_structure.md):** An overview of the repository layout.
* **[Contributing](contributing.md):** Guidelines for contributing to the project.
