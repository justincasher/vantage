# Welcome to Lean Automator Documentation

Lean Automator is a Python project designed to build and manage a mathematical knowledge base (KB). It leverages Lean 4 for formal verification, integrates with Large Language Models (specifically Google's Gemini) for potential code/description generation, and uses an SQLite database for persistent storage.

This documentation provides detailed information on setting up, configuring, and using Lean Automator.
